## How to create:
 I used the Vite CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. First, I made sure to have Node.js installed on my machine. Then, I installed Vite globally by running the command npm install -g create-vite.

`I have completed this using React and Vite. This project are static pages so some code are repeating for this. Throughout the project, I achieved the following:`

 1. **Project Setup:**
    - I set up the project using Vite, and install TailwindCss and React Router Dom for an optimized development experience and faster application startup.
 2. **React Components:**
    -  I created reusable React components like Navbar and footer. The navigation menu About and Home are functional.
 3. **Responsive Design:**
    -  I try to responsive the application, for all different devices.
